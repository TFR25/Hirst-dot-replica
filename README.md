<p>This is a recreation of David Hirst's spot painting.
Colorgram package was used to extract colors from one of my images taken of my cat with a bunch of Legos. Then, using the turtle module and the colors extracted from my picture, 90 random colored dots (9 rows of 10 dots each) were printed on the screen as seen below. </p>
